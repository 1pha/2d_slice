# 2D Slice Approach on sMRI
## Layouts
Using 3D sMRI to predict age(classification/regression) tends to fail on 3D CNN since -
+ **Sparse Kernels** compared to 3-square(9) and 3-cube(27)
+ **Blank Voxels** too many blanks

In order to tackle these problems, I was told to do this task with 2D CNNs and it has advantages of -
+ **More Data** Since there are only 1,187 brains
+ **Human-like?** Slice view for detecting symptoms is widely used method and this approach does that as well.
